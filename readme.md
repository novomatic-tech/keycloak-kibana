# keycloak-kibana

A Keycloak authorization plugin for Kibana

## Building the plugin

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js - v10.15.2
- Yarn - min. v1.10.1

**Building:**

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Artifacts will be produced in the `kibana-extra/keycloak-kibana/build` directory.

## Installing the plugin

Before you install the plugin, you must have Kibana installed in the `$KIBANA_HOME` directory.
You can download it [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana). Also make sure that you have configured 
plugin in the ``kibana.yml`` file before installation (there are several mandatory parameters).

```bash
# Remove the previously installed plugin (optional)
$ $KIBANA_HOME/bin/kibana-plugin.sh remove keycloak-kibana
# Install a new version of plugin
$ $KIBANA_HOME/bin/kibana-plugin.sh install file:./kibana-extra/keycloak-kibana/build/keycloak-kibana-0.1.0.zip
```

## Versioning and compatibility

The following versioning schema is used:

Kibana version | Plugin version
--- | ---
`5.4.3` | `1.0.0_5.4.3`
`5.6.9` | `1.0.0_5.6.9`
`6.2.4` | `1.0.0_6.2.4`
`6.6.1` | `2.0.0_6.6.1`
`6.6.2` | `2.0.0_6.6.2`
`7.0.0` | `3.0.0_7.0.0`
`7.0.1` | `3.0.0_7.0.1`
`7.1.1` | `3.0.0_7.1.1`

The second version in the plugin (after `'_'`) must correspond to your Kibana version or the plugin will fail.
If the required version is not available to download, you must build it yourself. Please read further for additional details on this topic.

**Racionale**

Kibana has quite rigid plugin compatibility model - each plugin must include the exact version of Kibana it is compatible with. 
This requirement enforces releasing a new version of the plugin each time a new version of Kibana is released (even when only "patch" changes were released). 

Since it's hard to keep up with Kibana release train,
this repository does not attempt to do it.
However, you can still try to build the plugin which works with
your Kibana version (the plugin was tested with the major Kibana releases and hardly anything has changed):

- Checkout the branch which corresponds to your kibana version (`6.x`, `7.x` etc).
- Just change the `kibana.version` property in the `package.json` file to your desired Kibana version.
- Build and install the plugin

## Configuration

## Extracting translations keys

According to the [documentation](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/7.0/src/dev/i18n/README.md), 
kibana has tool for extracting all translation keys from source code. Example:

  ```bash
  $ mkdir translations
  $ cd kibana
  $ node scripts/i18n_extract.js --path ../kibana-extra/keycloak-kibana --output-dir ../translations --include-config ../kibana-extra/keycloak-kibana/.i18nrc.json
  ```
