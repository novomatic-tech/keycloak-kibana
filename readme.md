# keycloak-kibana

A Keycloak authorization plugin for Kibana

## Building the plugin

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Artifacts will be produced in the `build` directory.

## Installing the plugin

Before you install the plugin, you must have Kibana installed in the `$KIBANA_HOME` directory.
You can download it [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana).

```bash
# Remove the  previously installed plugin (optional)
$ $KIBANA_HOME/bin/kibana-plugin.sh remove keycloak-kibana
# Install a new version of plugin
$ $KIBANA_HOME/bin/kibana-plugin.sh install file:./build/keycloak-kibana-0.1.0.zip
```

## Versioning and compatibility

The following versioning schema is used:

Kibana version | Plugin version
--- | ---
`5.3.0` | `1.0.0_5.3.0`
`5.4.3` | `1.0.0_5.4.3`
`5.6.9` | `1.0.0_5.6.9`
`6.2.4` | `1.0.0_6.2.4`


  The second version in the plugin (after `'_'`) must correspond to your Kibana version or the plugin will fail.
  If the required version is not available to download, you must build it yourself. Please read further for additional details on this topic.

  **Racionale**

  Kibana has quite rigid plugin compatibility model - each plugin must include the exact version of Kibana it is compatible with. 
  This requirement enforces releasing a new version of the plugin each time a new version of Kibana is released (even when only "patch" changes were released). 
  
  Since it's hard to keep up with Kibana release train,
  this repository does not attempt to do it.
  However, you can still try to build the plugin which works with
  your Kibana version (the plugin was tested with the major Kibana releases and hardly anything has changed):

  - Just change the `kibana.version` property in the `package.json` file to your desired Kibana version (it should work with 5.x - 6.2.x)
  - Build and install the plugin

## Configuration

The plugin is configurable via `config/kibana.yml` file residing in the Kibana home directory.
The following properties are available to be set.

Parameter | Description | Default

`keycloak.clientId` |  The client-id of the application. Each application has a client-id that is used to identify the application. This is REQUIRED. |
